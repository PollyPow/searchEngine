## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup Instructions

### PostgreSQL

1. Docker Image: Use the official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub.
2. Starting the Container: Run the following command:
```bash
docker run postgres
```
or
```bash
docker start <container_id>
```
### Opensearch
1. Docker Image: Use the official Opensearch and Opensearch Dashboards images from Docker Hub.
2. Docker Compose Configuration:
Add this to your docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  opensearch-node1:
    image: opensearchproject/opensearch:latest
    container_name: opensearch-node1
    environment:
      - cluster.name=opensearch-cluster # Name the cluster
      - node.name=opensearch-node1 # Name the node that will run in this container
      - discovery.seed_hosts=opensearch-node1,opensearch-node2 # Nodes to look for when discovering the cluster
      - cluster.initial_cluster_manager_nodes=opensearch-node1,opensearch-node2 # Nodes eligibile to serve as cluster manager
      - bootstrap.memory_lock=true # Disable JVM heap memory swapping
      - "OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m" # Set min and max JVM heap sizes to at least 50% of system RAM
      - "DISABLE_INSTALL_DEMO_CONFIG=true" # Prevents execution of bundled demo script which installs demo certificates and security configurations to OpenSearch
      - "DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true" # Disables Security plugin
    ulimits:
      memlock:

    volumes:
      - opensearch-data1:/usr/share/opensearch/data # Creates volume called opensearch-data1 and mounts it to the container
    ports:
      - 9200:9200 # REST API
      - 9600:9600 # Performance Analyzer

    volumes:
      - opensearch-data2:/usr/share/opensearch/data # Creates volume called opensearch-data2 and mounts it to the container
    networks:
      - opensearch-net # All of the containers will join the same Docker bridge network
  opensearch-dashboards:
    image: opensearchproject/opensearch-dashboards:latest
    container_name: opensearch-dashboards
    ports:
      - 5601:5601 # Map host port 5601 to container port 5601
    expose:
      - "5601" # Expose port 5601 for web access to OpenSearch Dashboards
    environment:
      - 'OPENSEARCH_HOSTS=["http://opensearch-node1:9200","http://opensearch-node2:9200"]'
      - "DISABLE_SECURITY_DASHBOARDS_PLUGIN=true" # disables security dashboards plugin in OpenSearch Dashboards
    networks:
      - opensearch-net

volumes:
  opensearch-data1:
  opensearch-data2:

networks:
  opensearch-net:
```
3. Starting the Container: Run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d opensearch-node1 opensearch-node2 opensearch-dashboards
```
